This is supposed to be able to control a chicken coop door over a webpage hosted by a raspberry pi (probably the zero 2 w).
I'm hoping to also add camera functionality. Probably the Raspberry Pi NoIR v2. I still need to figure out what hardware I'm using. I'll have to draft something up in cad and figure out the basic mechanical design.

I don't really know what I'm doing coding-wise. I have relatively little coding experience and part (most) of this is written by chatGPT.

If you'd like to help out, I would greatly appreciate it. Start a discussion or something and I'll get in touch.

Good luck to anyone trying to make sense of this
