This is supposed to be able to control a chicken coop door over a webpage hosted by a raspberry pi (probably the zero 2 w).
I'm hoping to also add camera functionality. Probably the Raspberry Pi NoIR v2.

idk what i'm doing. part (most) of this is written by chatGPT.

good luck to anyone trying to make sense of this
