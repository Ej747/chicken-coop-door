This is supposed to be able to control a chicken coop door over a webpage hosted by a raspberry pi (probably the zero 2 w).
I still need to figure out what hardware I'm using. I'll have to draft something up in cad and figure out the basic mechanical design. I'm hoping to also add camera functionality, likely the Raspberry Pi NoIR v2.

I don't really know what I'm doing coding-wise. I have relatively little coding experience sooo part of this is written by chatGPT.

If you'd like to help out, I would greatly appreciate it. Start a discussion or something and I'll get in touch.

Best of luck to anyone trying to make sense of this :)
